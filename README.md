# HandWriting Robot
Final Group Project for ECE387


## Project Members:
Sam Rutschilling, Brendan Moran, Deeparshan Khadka, and Michael Mattingly


# Introduction:

Our project is a handwriting robot for labels, it is designed to use a pen to write names or other text on to a label. This is to make more personable labels that have more depth and texture more similar to handwriting than labels printed by traditional printers.

The printer has a 3D printed frame with two 3D printed "carriages" for each axis (X and Y). The carriages for each axis are driven by stepper motors similar to a 3D printer. The carriages move back and forth on smooth, rigid plastic tubes desiged for use with cake decorating. Gears are printed into the design of the main body and X-Axis carriage for the stepper motors to interface with.

The Y-axis carriage, which is mounted to the X-axis carriage, contains the mount for the pen. The pen is controlled using a small 9-gram servo. The servo moves a small block vertically to determine if the pen is in contact with the surface of the paper. The pen holder is mounted to the Y-axis carriage using brass standoffs. Brass Standoffs also allow the pen holder to move freely.

As a group we used a Trello board to keep track of what tasks needed done, which were in progress, and which still needed completed.
