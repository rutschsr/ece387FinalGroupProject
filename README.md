Our project will be to construct a device that is a handwriting typewriter for labels. The device will be able to print labels as if they are handwritten.

The device will have a keyboard to enter desired text into and will be able to print approximatley 2x6 inches. Parts will be 3-D printed or otherwise constructed as needed.

The device will consist of an external carriage with two smooth rods supporting an internal carriage housing the pen. The internal carriage will be attached to a motor with a threaded rod allowing for a range of movement in the X-axis. Inside the internal carriage there will be another motor with a threaded rod along side a smooth rod to help assist move the pen in the Y-axis. Attached to these rods will be a stepper motor, holding the pen, so it will be able to be lifted up and down in the Z-axis.
